# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Project
Forest Ray

Repo for the course project of the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data Coursera course.

The run_analysis.R script does the following: 

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set. 
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set 
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive activity names. 
5. Creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
